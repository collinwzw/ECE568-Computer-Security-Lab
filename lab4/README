1. To get IP address of ecf.utoronto.ca, we called dig ecf.utoronto.ca. We
looked at output of this command to get name server and mail server IP address.
To direct to our Bind server, we use command:
dig @<IP of our ECF machine> -p <BIND listen-on port defined in named.conf> ecf.utoronto.ca
example:
dig @128.100.8.174 -p 5568 ecf.utoronto.ca

2. We establish a port that is listening on the query by using sock. Once we recieve the query, we forward to
the Bind server listen-on port defined in named.conf. We receive the response from Bind server using function
socket.recv() and forward to client.

3. We establish a port that is listening on the query by using sock. Once we recieve the query, we forward to
the Bind server listen-on port defined in named.conf. We receive the response from Bind server using function
socket.recv() and modify the response by using scapy. We than send the fake response back to client.

4.We firstly send a real query to google.ca to get a template DNS packet response. We then using scapy to modify
the template DNS response to what we want. We then generate random string as subdomain of example.com and then
send the query to Bind server. We forge the fake replies with random transaction IDs and send to Bind server as
fake DNS response. We send 100 fake responses for every subdomain query we sent.
